            <p class="card-text text-center"> Hey Y'all! My name is Jessica Ibarra and I am 27 years young and have been
                living in
                Texas all of my life! I grew up in a Hispanic household with wonderful parents and 2 brothers. I am the
                middle child, 4 years younger than my older brother and 18 years older than my little brother. I am
                lucky to have a supportive and caring family. After I graduated high school in 2011 I decided to go to
                community college. I studied for a couple years but ended up sticking to working and not finish school.
                Fast forward to 2015 I was surprised but happy to find out I would be having a baby. I became a mother
                in 2016 to the cutie in the picture. Her name is Emma and she is my pride and joy, my little sour patch
                kid. Emma is 3 going on 13... send help! Totally kidding, she is beautiful, brave, and brilliant. She is
                what keeps me going everyday and gets me through tough days. I currently have a full time job as a
                Business Analyst for a Healthcare company and have been in healthcare for 7 and half years. I am
                currently taking Southern Methodist University Coding Bootcamp course in hopes to expand my knowledge
                and seak a career change in the near future.</p>
